content: "Project developed as the CEO and Head of Cre8tive Tech development team. The Cre8tive Tech website is a React web application build with Gatsby. At this project I acted as the lead UI/UX developer specialist being the bridge
              between UI/UX Design, PO and the UI development team. The main challenge was to
              reorganize the UI structure from a react-virtualized grid into a pure CSS one.
              Which improved drastically the scalability and maintainability of the project."
technologies: "Gatsby, UI/UX Architecture, React, Firebase, HTML5, CSS3, Javascript ES6"
