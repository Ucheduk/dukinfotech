content: "Project developed as a contractor with the Topline Promoters team. The Topline Promoters website is a WordPress website build on top of custom theme and Elementor page builder. At this project I acted as the UI/UX Design, Web designer. The main challenge was to
              reorganize the UI structure from a react-virtualized grid into a pure CSS one.
              Which improved drastically the scalability and maintainability of the project."
