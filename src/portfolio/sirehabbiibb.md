content: "Project developed as a contractor with the SireHabbiibb team. The SireHabbiibb website is a WordPress website build on top of custom theme and Elementor page builder. At this project I acted as the UI/UX Design, Web designer. The main challenge was to design a simple and clean website.
              Using Elementor page builder with a lite custom theme I was proud of how clean and minimalist the site came out."
